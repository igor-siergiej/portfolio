# Infrastructure

Terraform for the static site: private **S3** bucket + **CloudFront** (Origin Access Control) + a **GitHub Actions OIDC** deploy role. No servers.

**Request path:** visitor → CloudFront (HTTPS) → OAC-signed read from the private S3 bucket. The bucket denies all public access; its policy only allows `cloudfront.amazonaws.com` scoped to this distribution's ARN.

**Deploy path:** push to `main` → GitHub Actions builds, then assumes `gha-deploy` via GitHub OIDC (no stored AWS keys) → `s3 sync` the build and issue a CloudFront invalidation.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.5
- AWS credentials with admin-ish rights for the initial apply (`aws configure` or `AWS_PROFILE`)

## First apply

Terraform state lives in an S3 backend (`backend.tf`) with native S3 locking — no DynamoDB
table needed. That bucket can't be created by the same Terraform config that needs it to
store its own state, so create it manually first:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://your-project-tfstate-<account-id> --region eu-west-2
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket your-project-tfstate-<account-id> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

Then replace `CHANGEME` in `infra/backend.tf`'s `bucket` with that real bucket name, and set
the same value for `tfstate_bucket` in a `terraform.tfvars` (gitignored, `infra/*.tfvars`):

```hcl
tfstate_bucket = "your-project-tfstate-<account-id>"
```

```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Wire up CI deploy

`terraform apply` prints four outputs. Set them as **GitHub repository variables**
(Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → *Variables*), or:

```bash
gh variable set S3_BUCKET                 -b "$(terraform output -raw bucket_name)"
gh variable set CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID -b "$(terraform output -raw distribution_id)"
gh variable set AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN       -b "$(terraform output -raw deploy_role_arn)"
gh variable set AWS_REGION                -b "$(terraform output -raw aws_region)"
gh variable set SITE_URL                  -b "https://your-domain.example"
```

Also set **`SITE_URL`**, to your real domain (or `terraform output -raw cloudfront_url` if you
haven't attached a custom domain yet). It's read at build time for every canonical URL,
OG tag, sitemap entry and RSS link — leaving it unset silently ships
`http://localhost:4321` everywhere.

After that, every push to `main` builds and deploys via `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
(no long-lived AWS keys — the workflow assumes the role through OIDC).

Live URL: `terraform output -raw cloudfront_url`.

## Wire up CI-driven terraform apply

`terraform apply` also prints `terraform_role_arn`. Set it as a **GitHub repository
variable**:

```bash
gh variable set AWS_TERRAFORM_ROLE_ARN -b "$(terraform output -raw terraform_role_arn)"
```

After that, `.github/workflows/terraform.yml` handles `infra/` changes: a PR touching
that path gets a `terraform plan` posted as a PR comment; a merge to `main` runs
`terraform apply` automatically (same OIDC trust model as the app deploy, no stored AWS
keys). The `gha-terraform` role itself has to exist before CI can assume it — bootstrap
it with one local `terraform apply` first, same as `gha-deploy`.

There's no branch-protection gate on the `plan` check (GitHub Pro is required for
required-status-checks on a private repo) — treat a red `plan` job as "don't merge yet",
not as something that physically blocks the merge button.

## Notes

- Bucket is private; only CloudFront can read it (OAC + bucket policy scoped to the distribution ARN).
- Bucket versioning is enabled for rollback after a bad deploy; noncurrent versions expire after 30 days.
- Responses carry a security headers policy (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, X-XSS-Protection).
- Routing: a missing/mistyped path is a real 404 — CloudFront maps 403/404 → `/404.html` (response code 404), not to the homepage.
- Caching: content-hashed `_astro/*` uploaded `immutable`; `images/*` (Keystatic overwrites these in place) uploaded with a 1-hour cache; every page, `sitemap*.xml`, `rss.xml` and `robots.txt` uploaded `no-cache` — set by the deploy job in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.
- `var.domain_hidden` (default `false`) 403s the real domain while `true`, leaving only the `*.cloudfront.net` URL reachable — use it to stage a domain pre-launch, then flip to `false` (or unset) to go live.
- If the account already has a GitHub OIDC provider, `terraform import` it into
  `aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.github` before applying (AWS allows only one per URL).
